## GOTY Public Performance Metrics

These metrics are derived from publicly available estimates
(Steam charts, sales announcements, industry reports).

Because platform-level telemetry is not public, the following
metrics are **approximations** used for comparative analysis:

- Estimated Monthly Active Players
- Estimated Total Owners
- Estimated Lifetime Revenue

These figures are intended to demonstrate analytics modeling,
not exact financial reporting.
